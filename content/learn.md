<h1>A Muted Existence</h1>
Over a billion people in the world, suffer from suboptimal hearing.  The experience of being unable to hear a conversation partner has a multitude of negative impacts: frustration, embarassment, missed connections, and ultimately, isolation.  Even more tragic is that the technology to change worlds has been dominated by a few large corporations that have shrouded this life-changing technology behind a wall of medicalization and sky-high costs.  The barrier of paying $6000 for a pair of hearing aids after a consultation with a doctor is often too high a barrier to cross.

<h1>A Paradigm Shift</h1>
The power of technology to change lives can be seen all around us.  Openhear is rejecting the model of medicalization and embracing the model of open source technology adoption that has been proven to change lives.  Our open hearing platform will be used by the best engineers and scientists in the world to deliver life-changing audio-processing algorithms directly to the ears of those who need it.
