<h1 style="color:#ff9900">A Muted Existence</h1>
Over 40 million Americans, and over a billion in the world, suffer from suboptimal hearing.  The experience of being unable to hear a conversation partner has a multitude of negative impacts: frustration, embarassment, missed connections, and ultimately, isolation.  Even more tragic is that the technology to change worlds has been dominated by a few large corporations that have shrouded this life-changing technology behind a wall of medicalization and sky-high costs.  The barrier of paying $6000 for a pair of hearing aids after a consultation with a doctor is often too high a barrier to cross.
