# Profitable Social Entrepreneurs
Openhear has chosen an open source model because it's the best way to undergo the revolution the hearing aid industry needs.  However, the misconception that open source isn't profitable has long been dispelled by the likes of Google, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, and may other industry heavyweights.  The public wants products from ethical businesses who are committed to quality and impact, and Openhear genuinely conveys those attributes straight from our founding commitment to openness to the execution of our ideas.  

# Early Funding
Openhear acheives a head start in this new industry by being positioned to take advantage of grant opportunities.  The scale of the problem is well known by policy makers and nonprofits, and Openhear's commitment to doing good first gives us a competetive advantage in the realm of fundraising.  We are well positioned to leverage both public and private capital to get our hearing aid platform to market.

# Operations
Openhear is the go-to hearing aid platform for researchers and engineers, and so will be the go-to hearing aid for consumers who simply want better hearing.  Via our smartphone application connection to the hearing aid, users will have access to algorithms that are tailored to their specific needs via the Openhear ecosystem.  On the aesthetic side, the ecosystem can flourish with custom designs that are both beautiful and practical.  This all revolves around Openhear's bread and butter:  selling hearing aids a complete, easy-to-use solution for a fair price.
